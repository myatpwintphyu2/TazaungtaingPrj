People also celebrate by releasing the hot air-balloon into the sky as an offering to the heavens to drive away evil spirits in Buddhist and Hindu cosmology which is similar to the Loi Krathong festival in Northern Thailand. Besides, people offer alms, candle lights, joss sticks, flowers and fruits as homage to the pagodas,alm-offering for monks and Satuditha meal serving for people as part of merit-making on the full-moon day of Tazaungdaing as well. Young people pay homage to elders (gadaw) and visit pagodas and do the merits  during the festival.
